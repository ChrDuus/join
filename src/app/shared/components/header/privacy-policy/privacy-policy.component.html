  Introduction and Overview
</h3>
<p>
  We have drafted this privacy policy (version 15.04.2025-312978532) to inform
  you in accordance with the provisions of the
  <a
    class="adsimple-312978532"
    href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=312978532#d1e2269-1-1"

    >General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a
  >
  and applicable national laws about the personal data (referred to as "data")
  that we – and processors commissioned by us (e.g., providers) – process, and
  will process in the future, and about the lawful options you have. All terms
  used are to be understood as gender-neutral.<br />
  <strong class="adsimple-312978532">In short:</strong> We provide full
  transparency about the data we process about you.
</p>
<p>
  Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. This
  privacy policy, however, is intended to describe the most important aspects in
  a simple and transparent way. Where helpful for understanding, we explain
  technical terms in a reader-friendly manner, provide links to further
  information, and use <strong class="adsimple-312978532">visual aids</strong>.
  We aim to inform clearly and plainly that we only process personal data in the
  course of our business activities when a legal basis exists. This is not
  possible when explanations are vague, brief, or overly legalistic—as is
  unfortunately common online. We hope you find the following explanations
  helpful and informative, and perhaps you’ll even learn something new.<br />
  If you still have questions, please contact the responsible entity listed
  below or in the legal notice, follow the provided links, or consult external
  sources for more information. Our contact details can of course also be found
  in the legal notice.
</p>
<h3 id="application" class="adsimple-312978532">Scope of Application</h3>
<p>
  This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us in our
  company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us
  (processors). "Personal data" refers to information as defined in Art. 4 para.
  1 GDPR, such as name, email address, and mailing address. Processing such data
  enables us to offer and invoice our services and products, whether online or
  offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:
</p>
<ul class="adsimple-312978532">
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    All our online presences (websites, online shops)
  </li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    Social media appearances and email communication
  </li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    Mobile apps for smartphones and other devices
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong class="adsimple-312978532">In short:</strong> This privacy policy
  applies to all areas where personal data is structured and processed via the
  channels listed. If we enter into a legal relationship with you through other
  means, we will inform you separately where applicable.
</p>

<h3 id="legal-basis" class="adsimple-312978532">Legal Basis</h3>
<p>
  In the following privacy policy, we provide transparent information about the
  legal principles and regulations, i.e., the legal bases of the General Data
  Protection Regulation (GDPR), which enable us to process personal data.<br />
  As far as the GDPR is concerned, we only process your data where at least one
  of the following applies:
</p>
<ul class="adsimple-312978532">
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    Consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR): You have given us consent to process data
    for a specific purpose. An example would be storing your entered data in a
    contact form.
  </li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    Contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR): To fulfill a contract or pre-contractual
    obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we conclude a
    purchase contract with you, we need personal information in advance.
  </li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    Legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR): If we are subject to a legal
    obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally required to
    keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.
  </li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    Legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR): We process data based on
    legitimate interests unless your fundamental rights and freedoms prevail.
    For example, we must process certain data to operate our website securely
    and efficiently. This processing is thus a legitimate interest.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As a rule, additional legal bases apply alongside the GDPR. For example,
  national laws such as the Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG) or the German
  Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). If other legal bases are relevant, we will
  indicate them in the following sections.
</p>
<p>
  <strong class="adsimple-312978532"
    >If you have questions about the legal basis, feel free to contact us via
    the contact details listed in the legal notice or this privacy
    policy.</strong

  We only store personal data for as long as it is absolutely necessary to
  provide our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as
  soon as the reason for data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are
  legally obligated to retain certain data even after the original purpose no
  longer applies, for example for accounting purposes.

<p>
  If you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent to data
  processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible, provided there is no
  obligation to retain it.
</p>

  processing, if we have further information on this.

  Introduction to Web Hosting
</h3>
<p>
  <strong class="adsimple-312978532">What is web hosting?</strong><br />
  When you visit websites today, certain information – including personal data –
  is automatically generated and stored, including on this website. This data
  should be processed as sparingly as possible and only with justification. By
  website, we mean the totality of all web pages on a domain, i.e., everything
  from the homepage to the last subpage (like example.com/start or
  example.com/contact).
</p>
<p>
  When you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program called a web
  browser. You enter a web address and the browser sends a request to another
  computer, the so-called web server. This web server then sends the required
  data back to your browser, which displays it on your screen. In this process,
  certain data is transmitted and stored either temporarily or permanently on
  the web server. This includes, for example:
</p>
<ul class="adsimple-312978532">
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    the IP address of your device (e.g., 192.168.0.1)
  </li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    browser and browser version (e.g., Chrome 87)
  </li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    the operating system used (e.g., Windows 10)
  </li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">the address (URL) of the accessed web page</li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">the date and time</li>
  <li class="adsimple-312978532">
    so-called HTTP status codes (e.g., “404 Not Found”)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As a rule, this data is stored for two weeks and then automatically deleted.
  We do not disclose this data, but we cannot rule out that it may be viewed by
  authorities in the event of unlawful behavior.
</p>
<p>
  <strong class="adsimple-312978532">In short:</strong> Your visit to our site
  generates data, and this data may be stored for a short time. We only use it
  where necessary and in accordance with the law.
